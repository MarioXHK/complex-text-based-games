    cout << "No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'." << endl;
    cout << "Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation." << endl;
    cout << "Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time." << endl;
    cout << "But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office." << endl;
